However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

Since the test is related to the `galaxy` package, a good next step might have been to explore classes or methods directly if we had class names. Given that we have very little to go on, we need to investigate why the URL is being prefixed with `api`.\n\nThe test mocks the `open_url` method in `galaxy_api`, suggesting that `open_url` constructs or retrieves these URLs. Investigating the implementation details of `open_url` within `galaxy_api` would be a logical step to understand where the extra `api/` is being inserted.\n\nHowever, without additional interactions left, the output from these attempts has not yielded any classes or methods to focus on, limiting the availability of viable options.\n\nNext steps would typically involve:\n1. Identifying if there is a misconfiguration causing `api/` inclusion, possibly originating from a base URL setup or concatenation logic within `open_url`.\n2. Examining the exact location where `open_url` is declared and how it processes URL components.\n\nIf exploration was successful:\n- Analyze how the base URL and endpoints are combined.\n- Confirm no extraneous segments (`api/`) are appended inadvertently in multiple places.\n\nRecommended fix locations: \n```plaintext\ngalaxy_api.open_url(...)\n```"

Since the test is related to the `galaxy` package, a good next step might have been to explore classes or methods directly if we had class names. Given that we have very little to go on, we need to investigate why the URL is being prefixed with `api`.\n\nThe test mocks the `open_url` method in `galaxy_api`, suggesting that `open_url` constructs or retrieves these URLs. Investigating the implementation details of `open_url` within `galaxy_api` would be a logical step to understand where the extra `api/` is being inserted.\n\nHowever, without additional interactions left, the output from these attempts has not yielded any classes or methods to focus on, limiting the availability of viable options.\n\nNext steps would typically involve:\n1. Identifying if there is a misconfiguration causing `api/` inclusion, possibly originating from a base URL setup or concatenation logic within `open_url`.\n2. Examining the exact location where `open_url` is declared and how it processes URL components.\n\nIf exploration was successful:\n- Analyze how the base URL and endpoints are combined.\n- Confirm no extraneous segments (`api/`) are appended inadvertently in multiple places.\n\nRecommended fix locations: \n```plaintext\ngalaxy_api.open_url(...)\n```"
