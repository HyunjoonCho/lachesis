However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

It appears there is either an issue with the available packages or the test itself is not correctly linked to any identifiable packages or classes in the system.\n\nHere's a diagnosis based on the information provided:\n\n### Diagnosis of test `test_galaxy.test_collection_install_with_url`\nThe test `test_collection_install_with_url` verifies the installation of a collection via a URL using the `GalaxyCLI` tool. The following steps are performed:\n\n1. Initializes `galaxy_args` to simulate the `ansible-galaxy` CLI command for collection installation.\n2. Executes this command using the `GalaxyCLI` class.\n3. Checks various conditions on the `mock_install` object to ensure the installation was correctly handled.\n\nGiven the assertions, it appears the primary focus is on ensuring `mock_install` is called correctly with the expected arguments. If these assertions are failing, it could be because:\n\n- The `GalaxyCLI` is not correctly processing the CLI arguments.\n- The `mock_install` method is not being called as expected within `GalaxyCLI`.\n- There could be an issue with the collection path being generated or used incorrectly.\n\nTo identify the exact problem, you would need to inspect the `GalaxyCLI.run` method and the part of the code where `mock_install` is invoked or defined.\n\nTo fix this, consider checking the following places:\n- `GalaxyCLI.run` method.\n- Any helper methods or utilities within `GalaxyCLI` involved in parsing and executing the collection install commands.\n\nBased on the diagnosis, I suggest inspecting these methods:\n\n```plaintext\nGalaxyCLI.run(args)\nMockInstallUtility.install(url, path, options)\n```\n\nAdjustments or fixes in these methods are likely to address the test failures."

It appears there is either an issue with the available packages or the test itself is not correctly linked to any identifiable packages or classes in the system.\n\nHere's a diagnosis based on the information provided:\n\n### Diagnosis of test `test_galaxy.test_collection_install_with_url`\nThe test `test_collection_install_with_url` verifies the installation of a collection via a URL using the `GalaxyCLI` tool. The following steps are performed:\n\n1. Initializes `galaxy_args` to simulate the `ansible-galaxy` CLI command for collection installation.\n2. Executes this command using the `GalaxyCLI` class.\n3. Checks various conditions on the `mock_install` object to ensure the installation was correctly handled.\n\nGiven the assertions, it appears the primary focus is on ensuring `mock_install` is called correctly with the expected arguments. If these assertions are failing, it could be because:\n\n- The `GalaxyCLI` is not correctly processing the CLI arguments.\n- The `mock_install` method is not being called as expected within `GalaxyCLI`.\n- There could be an issue with the collection path being generated or used incorrectly.\n\nTo identify the exact problem, you would need to inspect the `GalaxyCLI.run` method and the part of the code where `mock_install` is invoked or defined.\n\nTo fix this, consider checking the following places:\n- `GalaxyCLI.run` method.\n- Any helper methods or utilities within `GalaxyCLI` involved in parsing and executing the collection install commands.\n\nBased on the diagnosis, I suggest inspecting these methods:\n\n```plaintext\nGalaxyCLI.run(args)\nMockInstallUtility.install(url, path, options)\n```\n\nAdjustments or fixes in these methods are likely to address the test failures."
