This could be due to the structure of the test repository or the specific namespace used for organization.\n\nSince direct queries for classes have been ineffective, a better approach might be to investigate the `ShellModule` class directly, based on the provided test.\n\nLet's retrieve the methods covered by the failing test for the `ShellModule` class. This name was inferred from the test case:\n\n```python\npwsh = ShellModule()\n```\n\nI'll now call the `get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class` function, using an assumed prefix `your.base.package.path` for `ShellModule`. This would look something like `your.base.package.path.ShellModule`. This approach makes an educated guess about the probable file structure.
