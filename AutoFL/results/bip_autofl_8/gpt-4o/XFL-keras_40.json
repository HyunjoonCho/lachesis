However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

Specifically, the shapes of the states returned do not match the expectation hardcoded in the test.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Understanding the Failure**: \n   - The failing line `assert output_shape == expected_output_shape` reveals a mismatch. The test expects the shapes of the output tensors to include shapes for two LSTMCells, but instead, it appears to return repeated state sizes for the second LSTMCell states.\n\n2. **Code Path**:\n   - The method `RNN.compute_output_shape` generates the output shape based on the configuration parameters `return_sequences` and `return_state`.\n   - It computes the output dimension `output_dim` based on the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` (which in this case is a sequence of RNN cells). \n\n3. **Important Lines**:\n   - Lines 407-409 in `compute_output_shape`:\n     ```python\n     if self.return_state:\n         state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]\n         return [output_shape] + state_shape\n     ```\n     These lines calculate the shape of each state. The key part `for _ in self.states` is creating state shapes for each state, but it appears that `self.states` is longer than anticipated, which results in the repeated `(None, 6)` shapes found at indices 3 and 4, rather than `(None, 3)`.\n\n4. **Actual vs Expected**:\n   - The actual output shape includes repetitive shapes: `[(None, 5, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6)]`.\n   - The expected output shape expects the different state sizes: `[(None, 5, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 3), (None, 3)]`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe bug is likely due to the fact that the `compute_output_shape` method does not correctly consider that each cell in the `StackedRNNCells` should have an independent `state_size`. \n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nTo address this, we should ensure that the `RNN.compute_output_shape` method correctly computes state shapes for all individual cells within the StackedRNNCells.\n\n### Methods that likely need a fix:\n\nkeras.layers.recurrent.RNN.compute_output_shape"

An example answer would look like follows.\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of test `testGenerateURLFragment`\nDetails: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

Specifically, the shapes of the states returned do not match the expectation hardcoded in the test.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Understanding the Failure**: \n   - The failing line `assert output_shape == expected_output_shape` reveals a mismatch. The test expects the shapes of the output tensors to include shapes for two LSTMCells, but instead, it appears to return repeated state sizes for the second LSTMCell states.\n\n2. **Code Path**:\n   - The method `RNN.compute_output_shape` generates the output shape based on the configuration parameters `return_sequences` and `return_state`.\n   - It computes the output dimension `output_dim` based on the `state_size` attribute of the `cell` (which in this case is a sequence of RNN cells). \n\n3. **Important Lines**:\n   - Lines 407-409 in `compute_output_shape`:\n     ```python\n     if self.return_state:\n         state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]\n         return [output_shape] + state_shape\n     ```\n     These lines calculate the shape of each state. The key part `for _ in self.states` is creating state shapes for each state, but it appears that `self.states` is longer than anticipated, which results in the repeated `(None, 6)` shapes found at indices 3 and 4, rather than `(None, 3)`.\n\n4. **Actual vs Expected**:\n   - The actual output shape includes repetitive shapes: `[(None, 5, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6)]`.\n   - The expected output shape expects the different state sizes: `[(None, 5, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 3), (None, 3)]`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe bug is likely due to the fact that the `compute_output_shape` method does not correctly consider that each cell in the `StackedRNNCells` should have an independent `state_size`. \n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nTo address this, we should ensure that the `RNN.compute_output_shape` method correctly computes state shapes for all individual cells within the StackedRNNCells.\n\n### Methods that likely need a fix:\n\nkeras.layers.recurrent.RNN.compute_output_shape"
