However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case.

Specifically, it checks if the constructed URLs for pagination are correct and if the API calls are made the expected number of times.\n  \n- **Error Analysis:** The failure occurs because of a mismatch in the expected URL and the actual URL. The expected URL is:\n  ```\n  'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'\n  ```\n  But the actual URL obtained is:\n  ```\n  'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'\n  ```\n  The issue here is the presence of an extra `'api/'` in the actual URL compared to the expected one.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The error suggests there might be an incorrect URL formation in the method responsible for constructing these paginated URLs. Specifically, a double `'api/'` is being inserted, leading to the mismatch.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\nOne might need to check the URL formation logic in the relevant method of the `galaxy_api` class.\n\nTo provide specific suggestions for fix locations, further investigation into the class and method responsible for URL construction in the `galaxy` package is needed."

Specifically, it checks if the constructed URLs for pagination are correct and if the API calls are made the expected number of times.\n  \n- **Error Analysis:** The failure occurs because of a mismatch in the expected URL and the actual URL. The expected URL is:\n  ```\n  'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'\n  ```\n  But the actual URL obtained is:\n  ```\n  'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'\n  ```\n  The issue here is the presence of an extra `'api/'` in the actual URL compared to the expected one.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The error suggests there might be an incorrect URL formation in the method responsible for constructing these paginated URLs. Specifically, a double `'api/'` is being inserted, leading to the mismatch.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\nOne might need to check the URL formation logic in the relevant method of the `galaxy_api` class.\n\nTo provide specific suggestions for fix locations, further investigation into the class and method responsible for URL construction in the `galaxy` package is needed."
